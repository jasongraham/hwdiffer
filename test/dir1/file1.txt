We were pretty surprised when it lasted more than 30 seconds. Everything in the
room began to sway from side to side, and other teachers in my school began
running to hold shut the cupboards of tea cups.

It felt like you'd think an earthquake would feel, like being on a boat in
a storm with no idea how long you'll be out to sea.

A few students took it as an opportunity to joke around with me in English (if
they've learned nothing else from me, they now know the word "earthquake"), but
a few other students were crying, some from shock and some from actual concern.

Many of these students have parents who commute to Tokyo for work. With phones
down and trains shut down, they had no way of knowing if their families were
okay or if they would be able to come home tonight.

Everyone I know is physically alright, but most are shaken and many are
stranded in Tokyo.

Now we're all just waiting out the aftershocks and letting our families know
we're all right. I have never been so grateful for the Internet in my life.
